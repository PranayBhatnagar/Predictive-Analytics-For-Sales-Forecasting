# Predictive Analysis for Sales Forecasting

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict sales based on a decade's worth of retail data. It aims to enhance business decision-making by providing accurate forecasts and actionable insights derived from comprehensive data analysis and modeling.

Visualizations include distribution plots of key variables like item weights and sales, categorical feature counts such as item types and outlet sizes, and time-series representations of sales trends over establishment years. These visuals facilitate understanding patterns and relationships crucial for predictive modeling and strategic planning in retail operations.

## Objective

This project aims to develop a robust predictive model for forecasting sales based on historical data from a retail environment spanning the past decade. The primary objectives are:

1. **Sales Prediction Accuracy**: Implement machine learning techniques to accurately forecast sales figures for future periods. By leveraging historical sales data, the model will learn patterns and trends that influence sales fluctuations over time.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore and engineer relevant features that can enhance the predictive power of the model. This includes transforming existing data and incorporating external factors such as promotional activities, economic indicators, and seasonal variations.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Conduct thorough data preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset is clean, complete, and formatted correctly for model training. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

4. **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable model for sales forecasting. Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Insights Generation**: Extract meaningful insights from the model's predictions to inform strategic business decisions. These insights may include identifying high-performing products, optimizing inventory management, and planning effective marketing campaigns.

6. **Scalability and Deployment**: Design the model with scalability in mind, enabling it to handle large volumes of data and adapt to changing business environments. Consider deployment strategies for integrating the model into operational processes to support real-time decision-making.

7. **Documentation and Communication**: Document the entire process from data collection to model deployment, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Communicate findings and recommendations effectively to stakeholders, empowering them to utilize the predictive capabilities for business growth.

By achieving these objectives, this project aims to demonstrate the value of predictive analytics in enhancing business efficiency, improving sales forecasting accuracy, and driving strategic decision-making in retail operations.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost


## Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from [Big Mart Sales Prediction Dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/)

## Data Collection and Processing


1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   Ensure all missing values in important features like 'Item_Weight' and 'Outlet_Size' are appropriately filled using methods like mean or mode imputation, based on the nature of the data.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   Create new features that might enhance prediction accuracy, such as combining or transforming existing features. For example, derive a new feature like 'Years_Established' from 'Outlet_Establishment_Year' to capture the age of the outlet.

3. **Categorical Data Encoding:**
   Encode categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models. Use techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding for features such as 'Item_Fat_Content' and 'Outlet_Type'.

4. **Normalization and Scaling:**
   Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary to bring them to a standard scale. This ensures that features with different ranges contribute equally to model training.

5. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**
   Identify outliers in numerical features that might affect model performance. Decide on appropriate strategies such as capping, transformations, or excluding outliers based on domain knowledge.

6. **Data Splitting:**
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Typically, a common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

## Results

The XGBoost model achieved an R² score of `r2_train` on the training set and `r2_test` on the testing set, indicating good predictive performance.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run the notebook or script in your preferred environment.

## Future Work

- Implement more advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
- Deploy the model into a production environment.
